This POC has the functionality of displaying a carousel of wall panels, allowing users to click on them which will apply the panel to all the available walls, with appropriate tiling values.

## Setup

Once you have opened the project in Unity, there are a few things you need to do manually, for the project to be ready to work with.

- In the Project Assets panel, go to the Scenes folder and open the SampleScene.

- Now go to the top menu and select File -> Build Settings...

The Build Settings window will appear...

1. Make sure that SampleScene is added to the Scenes In Build list.
2. Select Android from the Platform list.
3. Change Texture Compression to ASTC.
4. Click the Switch Platform Button.

After connecting the Quest 3, you can click on "Build and Run" and run the app.
